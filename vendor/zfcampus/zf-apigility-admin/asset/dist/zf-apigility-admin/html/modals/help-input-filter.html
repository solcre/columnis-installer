    <p>
        Fields are used to both describe expected data, as well
        as specify how that data should be validated.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clicking the "Create New Field" button will prompt you
        for a field name, and then create it. If you want to
        change the name later, click the name to edit it.
        Click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></i> icon to remove the field.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fields are comprised of:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A "required" flag - is the field required in order to
        validate?</li>
        <li>An "allow empty" flag - can the field be a null or
        empty string and still be considered valid?</li>
        <li>A "continue if empty" flag - if the field is empty and
        required, should the validations still be run?</li>
        <li>One or more <em>validators</em>.</li>
        <li>One or more <em>filters</em>, used to normalize the
        field prior to validation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Validators and filters may be added, manipulated, and
        removed in the same ways. In each case, you must first Click
        the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></i> icon to
        expand the input and reveal the "Add Validator" and "Add
        Filter" buttons.  Adding either will reveal a form that
        allows you to select from available validators or filters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Validators and filters will be executed in the order in which they
        appear in the admin tool; you may grab the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-resize-vertical"></i> icon in order
        to drag and re-order them. Clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></i> icon will
        remove it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most validators and filters also support a number of options. After
        adding one, you may add options; these may be
        selected from a dialog, and an appropriate form input 
        will then be provided to allow you to specify a value.
        You cannot edit options after creating them; however,
        you can remove them via the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></i> icon and re-add them with
        the changes you desire.
