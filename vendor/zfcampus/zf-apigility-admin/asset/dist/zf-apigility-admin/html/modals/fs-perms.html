    <h4 class="text-danger">Filesystem is not writable!</h4>

    <p>
        We have detected that your Apigility Admin API is running
        without the ability to write to one of the following
        directories:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>config/</code></li>
        <li><code>config/autoload/</code></li>
        <li><code>module/</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        As such, the Apigility Admin API will not be able to do its
        work, which involves writing and updating configuration files,
        as well as generating PHP class stubs.
    </p>

    <p>
        To correct the issue, make these directories, and all
        descendents, writable by the user under which the web server is
        running (we've determined <strong>"{{ user }}"</strong> from the
        server).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have updated the permissions, reload this page.
    </p>
